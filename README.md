# NextClick Error Page

This is a simple error page that can be used to display an error message to users when an issue occurs on your website. It provides a clear message to users, advises them to avoid refreshing the page, and informs them that your technical team is working on resolving the issue.

## Getting Started

To use this error page, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Customize the error message:
    - Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.
    - Replace the placeholder text with your desired error message.
3. Save the changes to the `index.html` file.
4. Deploy the error page to your web server or hosting platform of choice.
5. Configure your server or hosting platform to serve the `index.html` file as the default error page for HTTP status codes such as 500 or 503.
6. Test the error page by intentionally causing an error or simulating an error condition.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the error page according to your needs. You can modify the styling, colors, fonts, or any other aspect of the HTML and CSS code in the `index.html` file to match your branding or design preferences.
